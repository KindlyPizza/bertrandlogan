I suppose I should address the name of this blog, If not for all of you then certainly for me.

When I got my first plants, I imagined that owning a plant would be like owning a thing. A living thing but a thing nonetheless, I imagined in my mind of minds that this object would grow larger but otherwise be static. It would exist in perpetuity with my minimal contributions of water and plant food whatever that would turn out to be.

Well the first thing I discovered is that plants are quite partial to liquefied fish amongst other things, but liquefied fish is definitely up there for them. The next thing I discovered is plants die, like for no reason at all they just die on you. It did not help that I was rearing these plants in a 60cm by 20cm planter sitting on the driveway outside my tiny garage apartment. Repeated efforts to grow plants in more controlled environments or even larger ones has by and far resulted in Tragedy. A Parsley that lived for a couple of years died on me this summer and I don't know why. 

Things die, things change and this isn't new information to anyone but unless you hold it in your mind you might find that like me, plants frustrate you. I've had to revaluate my relationship with plants. They're not there for my benefit, to exist forever. They will live their lives and considering my mediocre care, those lives will likely be shorter than they could be with any care other than mine but life's not fair, definitely not for plants.

So I'll appreciate the time I have with them now, and maybe that means I'll care for them better.

I could probably apply this lesson to the rest of my life, I might even look after myself then.

Who knows?

If you should take one thing away from all this;

It's that I certainly don't.
